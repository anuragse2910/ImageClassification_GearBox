## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

- Data collection and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model selection
- Training the model
- Evaluating the model
- Optimizing the model
- Presenting the results

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of images of various types of gearboxes. The images are labeled according to their respective gearbox types.

## Preprocessing

The images are preprocessed to ensure they are in a format suitable for the model. This includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation to increase the size and diversity of the dataset.

## Model Architecture

A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for this project. The architecture of the model is designed to effectively extract features from the images and classify them into their respective gearbox types.

## Training

The model is trained using the preprocessed dataset. The training process involves feeding the images into the model, adjusting the model's weights based on the error, and repeating this process for a specified number of epochs.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Optimization

The model's performance is optimized using techniques such as gradient boosting and neural network tuning. These techniques help fine-tune the model for improved accuracy and performance.

## Results

The results of the project are presented in a clear and concise manner, including the model's performance metrics and examples of the model's predictions.

## Future Work

Possible future work includes collecting more data, exploring different model architectures, and implementing advanced optimization techniques.

## Streamlit Web App

To make the model more accessible and user-friendly, a Streamlit web app was created. This app allows users to input text and receive the model's predictions in real-time.
